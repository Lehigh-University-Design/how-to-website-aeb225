          <b>Preheat the Oven:  </b>
          Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper to prevent sticking.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cream the Butter and Sugars:  </b>
          In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter, granulated sugar, packed brown sugar, and vanilla extract together until the mixture is creamy and smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Add Eggs:  </b>
          Beat in the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition until the batter is well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Combine Dry Ingredients:  </b>
          In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture to the wet mixture, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Add Chocolate Chips:</b>
          Gently fold in the chocolate chips using a spatula or wooden spoon. Make sure the chocolate chips are evenly distributed throughout the dough.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Scoop the Dough:</b>
          Use a cookie scoop or a spoon to drop rounded tablespoons of cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheets. Leave some space between the cookies to allow for spreading.
        </li>
