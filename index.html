    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
      <b><ol>
        <li>
          <b>Preheat the Oven:  </b>
          Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper to prevent sticking.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cream the Butter and Sugars:  </b>
          In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter, granulated sugar, packed brown sugar, and vanilla extract together until the mixture is creamy and smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Add Eggs:  </b>
          Beat in the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition until the batter is well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Combine Dry Ingredients:  </b>
          In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture to the wet mixture, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Add Chocolate Chips:  </b>
          Gently fold in the chocolate chips using a spatula or wooden spoon. Make sure the chocolate chips are evenly distributed throughout the dough.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Scoop the Dough:  </b>
          Use a cookie scoop or a spoon to drop rounded tablespoons of cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheets. Leave some space between the cookies to allow for spreading.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Bake the Cookies:  </b>
          Place the baking sheets in the preheated oven and bake for about 9 to 11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown but the centers still look slightly soft. Remember that cookies will continue to bake a little after you take them out of the oven due to residual heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cool and Enjoy:  </b>
          Remove the baking sheets from the oven and let the cookies cool on the sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Serve: </b>
          Once the cookies are completely cool, they are ready to be enjoyed! Serve with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage.
        </li>
